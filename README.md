Tools
---------------------
* **GitHub Desktop**, avaliable [here](https://desktop.github.com/), if you need help setting this up, talk to me (Seb) and I'll help you out. By the by, you'll also need an account on [github](https://github.com/), and you can apply for a student account [here](https://education.github.com/pack). A student account is not required though it will be helpful for the programmers.
* **Unity 5.1.1**, avaliable [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive), make sure to get 5.1.1 as it matches the machines in the university.

If there's any other program that needs to be added in future, or if there's anything you want added to this readme, just contact me on Skype or Facebook and I'll get it added.
